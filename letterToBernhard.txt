polite request

Dear Bernhard,

during my "onboarding interview" in summer 2021, when my status in Bee Systems was reviewed, we talked about increasing my hourly rate and you said that you are happy to give me what I asked before (that was 42 eur/hour). As there were others present and I specified my price in the onboarding pre-talks to 35 eur/hour, I sticked with it, to keep my word.

Now, with all the prices for consumables, rents and energies jumping up, your sentence about agreeing to my originally asked hourly rate replays in my head very often.

So, I would like to ask now AGAIN - can I increase my hourly rate to 42 eur/hour starting this month?

Please, let me know how :-)

With best regards,
Filip
